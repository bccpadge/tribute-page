        <p class="paragraph-one">
          Everyone takes a different path in their life. She is the person who changed my life for the better. I am so grateful to have her as a mother because there are so many people looking for a
          forever family.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-two">
          In a world that is full of hate find the light wherever you can. It will always make a big difference and no matter what the gesture is small or big. It is okay to different and you are
          enough. Do not let others tell you anything else because you deserves to love and be loved.
